            <p>People say, life must have a clear purpose so that it can bring good provisions in the afterlife. Therefore, this is the purpose of my life:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worship and carry out orders and stay away from Allah's prohibitions</li>
                    <li>I want to be a useful person for others</li>
                    <li>I want to learn and study until my age ends</li>
                    <li>Teaching the knowledge that I have to others even though the knowledge is small</li>
                    <li>Make my parents proud of me both in the affairs of this world and the hereafter</li>
                    <li>Be a simple woman</li>
                    <li>That's all, my life goals are many, let's talk another time hehe:D</li>
                </ul>
            </p><br><br>

                <h3>ADDITIONAL ABILITIES</h3><hr>

                </p><br><br>
            <h3>MY MESSAGE FOR YOU</h3><hr>
